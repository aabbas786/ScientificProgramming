CHALLENGE: Write a program that converts the above shopping list from this file
into a Python dictionary with the section headings Drinks, Breakfast, Lunch,
and Dinner as keys, and a list of each of the items under each heading as
values.

The function load_shopping_list should take a file name as an argument and
return the portion of the file that proceeds a '==========' delimeter. 
We'll start with baby steps - we can call the function and it returns a
string:

  >>> from shoppinglist import *
  >>> shoplist = load_shopping_list('shoppinglist.txt')
  >>> type(shoplist)
  <class 'str'>
